```

```
"How is Gold performing?"

### For Filtering
```
"Show profitable trades"
"Find losing Gold trades"

```

## Tips for Best Results

### 💡 **Writing Effective Queries**
1. **Be conversational**: "How are we doing?" works better than "PnL status"
2. **Be specific**: "Gold performance" vs "commodity performance"
3. **Ask follow-ups**: "Show Gold trades" then "How profitable are they?"
4. **Use natural language**: "What's our best commodity?" not "MAX(pnl) GROUP BY commodity"

### 🎯 **Getting Better Insights**
- **Start broad**: "Overall performance" then narrow down
- **Ask why**: "Why are we losing money on Silver?"
- **Request recommendations**: "What should we do about losing trades?"
- **Combine queries**: "Show profitable Gold trades and explain the pattern"

### 🔍 **Effective Filtering**
- **Use quotes**: `Commodity is "Gold"` for exact matches
- **Be specific**: "John Smith's trades" vs "Smith trades"
- **Combine filters**: "Profitable Gold trades above 100"
- **Use timeframes**: "This month's trades" or "Recent Gold trades"

- Ask more specific questions: "Gold PnL" instead of "Performance"
- Request explanations: "Why are we losing money?"
- Ask for details: "Break down the Gold performance"
- Request recommendations: "What should we do about this?"
